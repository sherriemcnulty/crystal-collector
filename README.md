# crystal-collector
This program was written with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Media Query and jQuery.

The game starts in an inactive state, listening for the user to click a link in the instructions.
Once that link is pressed:

1. A random target value, in the range of 19 - 120, is generated and displayed.

2. A sum of 0 is also displayed.

3. Random numbers, in the range of 1 - 12, are generated and assigned to each of the crystal balls. (These values are hidden)

4. Click events are assigned to each of the balls.

5. When a crystal ball is clicked, the value of that ball is added to the sum.

6. Win when the sum equals the target value.

7. Lose if the sum exceeds the target value.

8. You can start over at any time by clicking on the startup link.
